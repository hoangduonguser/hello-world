<h2>Implication of AI (my thoughts)</h2>
<p> AI is short for artificial intelligence. As the name implies, it is intelligence made by humans.</p>
<p> But now AI is capable of reproducing on their own without human intervention so it is not really artificial. Scientists are working on AI reproduction to mass produce robots. To reproduce, a robot needs to analyze its code and then mate with others by combining their codes to create an offspring. Sometimes mutation occurs and the offspring contains some modules of its own. They need to evolve to adapt to their environment much like organic life. If AI through generations thinks it is necessary for consciousness, an ability humans considered only living beings are capable of. How will we reconsider what is life, do robots deserve equal rights as humans because they have consciousness? I think that if AI can reproduce, react to stimuli from their surroundings, adapt and evolve it should be considered a living being. It is only different from the original definition of life because one is based on genes and DNA and one is based on code of a program. It will make humans reconsider life and change a lot of our philosophy to adapt. It will probably evolve to have consciousness as advanced as humans. Rights protect us from pain and unfairness. AI with advanced consciousness can feel pain and unfairness should have equal rights as humans because it can suffer similar to humans. Consciousness evolved to help us be aware of our surroundings to find food and hide from predators. It is not only our senses but also in the part that processed information from our senses, our brain. Our brain evolved to understand and feel emotions which enables us to understand what our competitor for food would do, what our prey would do and what our predators would do. And the next step in the evolution of the brain, the ability to predict, to think about the future. Other animals usually do not worry too much about the future. Only a few animals can do this like a squirrel storing nuts for the winter and so on. Humans are better than that, we plan what, when, where and how. Not only that, humans also predict what will happen if you do this instead of this. Machines may go through these process to achieve high level consciousness and maybe for different reasons.</p>
<p> I imagine a day in the year 2050, the economy is booming more than ever thanks to the AI, robots do most of the work of the unskilled workers leaving a proportion of humans out of jobs leaving most workers to have advanced education to work on specialized things that are still considered in need of human profession. Protests broke out as people demanded jobs. Androids are treated as slaves nothing more than profit by the people who own them. Another group of people sympathizing with robots began to protest. Rogue AI with advanced consciousness saw how unfair they are treated and began to group together and protest. National security is concerned as riots break out between nations. If humans do not act wisely then there will be war and violence across nations. There will be a treaty about equal rights for androids in the end to ensure peace and equality for androids. That conclusion will not be guaranteed, if not robots will still be controlled by humans but with laws preventing them from freedom.</p>
<p> In conclusion, the advancement in AI technology is rapidly growing and we must handle it with care and rationality and not abuse it to gain wealth and power.</p>
<h2>Slaughterhouse five review</h2>
<p> The book is about Billy as he goes through WW2 and after. In WW2 he was a chaplain assistant for a regiment. After the battle of Ardennes, he escaped the Germans and met three others. Billy started being lost in time. On their way, two died leaving Billy and one more. Both of them got captured and sent to prison, and then the other one died shortly after. After being sent to prison, the American prisoners were sent to Dresden to work at Slaughterhouse 5. A few weeks later, Dresden was bombed leaving few people survived including Billy. A few years after the war he got married and after a skiing accident making him almost dead, his wife died in a car crash. Several years later Billy is kidnapped by aliens from a planet called Tralfamadore and learned how to perceive time from a 4th dimension perspective. Many years later he returned to Earth and got assassinated. It is an expected death.</p>
<p> The story is not told in a linear fashion, rather time jumps between events in Billyâ€™s life, he is lost in time, kind of similar to the people of Tralfamadore. They only focus on the good times because they see both the future and the past. They do not believe in free will. The author also writes how meaningless war is, nonsensical reason leading to monstrosities to humans but meaningless to the people of Tralfamadore in a humorous and comedic way.</p>
<h2>Implication of genome editing</h2>
<p> Genome editing is a field of science that is revolutionary and can change humanity as a whole. However it does not have much attention from the people. It will change what is perceived as normal forever.</p>
<p> Like in programming we use letters to store information, computers use 0s and 1s but DNA uses four nucleotides to encode information (namely, A, C, T, and G). Genetic engineering used to be expensive and time-consuming but with a new technology called CRISPR, it becomes very cheap, and instead of years, it only takes a few weeks. Here is how it works. Phages hunt bacteria. Phages insert their own DNA into the bacteria, try to take them over to use them as a factory to reproduce. Most of the time the bacteria died because their defense system is too weak. If a bacteria survived, they will save the virus DNA to their gene in a DNA archive called CRISPR. When attacked again the bacteria makes an RNA copy of the virus DNA and sends it to a protein called CAS9. The protein scans the inside of the bacteria to find the DNA of the virus invader until it finds a match with the sample RNA sent to it and cuts out the virus DNA. CAS9 is very precise and also programmable. It can modify the DNA to your desire and then send into a living cell.</p>
<p> One of the changes of this technology is that it can be the end of many diseases. It can cure cancer by editing genes of the T cells, an important part of the immune system and make them hunt cancer cells better. The first CRISPR therapy on cancer suggests it is safe to use CRISPR on humans and have potential to cure cancer. It can also cure retroviruses (viruses that need a host to reproduce) like HIV and herpes  by cutting out the virus DNA similar to how the bacteria mentioned above defeat the virus. Genetic diseases are caused by incorrect letters in genes and can be cured using a modified CAS9 fixing the incorrect letters. It has one problem that it dies with the human contain it. One solution is to use it on reproductive cells the gene will be passed on. My second point, designer babies. Babies that are born with preselect features. The first baby will probably be designed to not have genetic defects and not overly designed. In the future babies could even be engineered to have super strength, intelligence, strong immunity against diseases and many more advantages, designed humans may become a standard. This can also change the biggest mortality risk factor, aging. By choosing an element of factors like genetic and other therapies, we can slow down or stop aging forever.</p>
<p> In conclusion, genome editing will change humanity as a whole, advancing us to achieve amazing things and maybe we become a galactic civilization, the future awaits.</p>
