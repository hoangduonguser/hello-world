<h2>Implication of AI on daily life, morality and philosophy (my thoughts)</h2>
<p> AI is short for artificial intelligence. As the name implies, it is intelligence made by humans.</p>
<p> But now AI is capable of reproducing on their own without human intervention so it is not really artificial. If AI through generations thinks it is necessary of consciousness, an ability humans considered only living beings is capable of. How will we reconsider what is life, do robots deserve equal rights as humans because they have consciousness? I think that if AI can reproduce, react to stimuli from their surroundings, adapt and evolve it should be considered a living being. It is only different from the original definition of life because one is carbon based and one is data based. It will make humans reconsider life and change a lot of our philosophy to adapt. It will probably evolve to have consciousness as advanced as humans. Rights protect us from pain and unfairness. AI with advanced consciousness can feel pain and unfairness should have equal rights as humans because it can suffer similar to humans.</p>
<p> I imagine a day in the year 2050, the economy is booming more than ever thanks to the AI, robots do most of the work of the unskilled workers leaving a proportion of humans out of jobs leaving most workers to have advanced education to work on specialized things that are still considered in need of human profession. Protests broke out as people demanded jobs. Androids are treated as slaves nothing more than profit by the people who own them. Another group of people sympathizing with robots began to protest. Rogue AI with advanced consciousness saw how unfair they are treated and began to group together and protest. National security is concerned as riots broke out between nations. If humans do not act wisely then there will be war and violence across nations. There will be a treaty about equal rights for androids in the end to ensure peace and equality for androids.</p>
<h2>Slaughterhouse-Five review</h2>
<p> The book is about Billy as he goes through WW2 and after. In WW2 he was a chaplain assistant for a regiment. After the battle of Ardennes, he escaped the Germans and met three others. Billy started being lost in time. On their way, two died leaving Billy and one more. Both of them got captured and sent to prison, and then the other one died shortly after. After being sent to prison, the American prisoners were sent to Dresden to work at Slaughterhouse 5. A few weeks later, Dresden was bombed leaving few people survived including Billy. A few years after the war he got married and after a skiing accident making him almost dead, his wife died in a car crash. Several years later Billy is kidnapped by aliens from a planet called Tralfamadore and learned how to perceive time from a 4th dimension perspective. Many years later he returned to Earth and got assassinated. It is an expected death.</p>
<p> The story is not told in a linear fashion, rather time jumps between events in Billyâ€™s life, he is lost in time, kind of similar to the people of Tralfamadore. They only focus on the good times because they see both the future and the past. They do not believe in free will. The author also writes how meaningless war is, nonsensical reason leading to monstrosities to humans but meaningless to the people of Tralfamadore in a humorous and comedic way.</p>
<h2>Implication of genome editing</h2>
<p>  Genome editing is a field of science that is revolutionary and can change humanity as a whole. But it does not have much attention from the people. It will change what is perceived as normal forever.</p> 
 <p>Before humans discovered genes and DNA, like in programming we use letters to store information, computers use 0s and 1s but DNA uses four nucleotides to encode information (A, C, T, G). Genetic engineering used to be expensive and time-consuming but with a new technology called CRISPR, it becomes very cheap and instead of years, it only takes a few weeks. Here is how it works, starts with phages (a type of virus) and bacteria. Phages hunt bacteria. Phages insert their own DNA into the bacteria, try to take them over to use them as a factory to reproduce. Most of the time the bacteria died because their defense system is too weak. If a bacteria survived, they will save the virus DNA to their gene in a DNA archive called CRISPR. When attacked again the bacteria make an RNA copy of the virus DNA. A protein called CAS9, it scans the bacteria to find the DNA of the virus invader until it finds a match with the sample RNA sent to it and cuts out the virus DNA. CAS9 is very precise and also programmable. It can modify the DNA and then send into a living cell.</p>
 <p>CRISPR can change humanity forever. One of them is that it can be the end of many diseases. It can cure cancer by editing genes of the T cells, an important part of the immune system and make them hunt cancer cells better. The first CRISPR therapy on cancer suggests it is safe to use CRISPR on humans and have potential to cure cancer. It can also cure retroviruses (viruses that need a host to reproduce) like HIV, herpes, etc by cutting out the virus DNA similar to how the bacteria mentioned above defeat the virus. Genetic diseases caused by incorrect letters in genes and can be cured using a modified CAS9 fixing the incorrect letters. It has one problem that it dies with the human contain it. But if you use it on reproductive cells the gene will be passed on. Which brings me to my second point, designer babies. Babies that are born with preselect features. The first baby will probably be designed to not have genetic defects and not overly designed. In the future babies could even be engineered to have super strength, intelligence, strong immunity against diseases, etc humanity as a whole will be changed forever and designed human may become a standard. This can also change the biggest mortality risk factor aging. By choosing an element of factors like genetic and other therapies we can slow down or stop aging forever.</p>
 <p>Conclusion, genome editing will change humanity as a whole, advancing us to achieve great things and help us become a powerful civilization, the future awaits.</p>
