<h2>Implication of AI on daily life, morality and philosophy</h2>
<p> AI is short for artificial intelligence. As the name implies, it is intelligence made by humans.
But now AI is capable of reproducing on their own without human intervention so it is not really artificial. If AI through generations thinks it is necessary of consciousness, an ability humans considered only living beings is capable of. How will we reconsider what is life, do robots deserve equal rights as humans because they have consciousness? I think that if AI can reproduce, react to stimuli from their surroundings, adapt and evolve it should be considered a living being. It is only different from the original definition of life because one is carbon based and one is data based. It will make humans reconsider life and change a lot of our philosophy to adapt. It will probably evolve to have consciousness as advanced as humans. Rights protect us from pain and unfairness. AI with advanced consciousness can feel pain and unfairness should have equal rights as humans because it can suffer similar to humans. I imagine a day in the year 2050, the economy is booming more than ever thanks to the AI, robots do most of the work of the unskilled workers leaving a proportion of humans out of jobs leaving most workers to have advanced education to work on specialized things that are still considered in need of human profession. Protests broke out as people demanded jobs. Androids are treated as slaves nothing more than profit by the people who own them. Another group of people sympathizing with robots began to protest. Rogue AI with advanced consciousness saw how unfair they are treated began to group together and protest. National security is concerned as riots broke out between nations. If humans do not act wisely then there will be war and violence across nations. There will be a treaty about equal rights for androids in the end to ensure peace and equality for androids.</p>
