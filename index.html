<h2>Implication of AI on daily life, morality and philosophy (my thoughts)</h2>
<p> AI is short for artificial intelligence. As the name implies, it is intelligence made by humans.</p>
<p> But now AI is capable of reproducing on their own without human intervention so it is not really artificial. If AI through generations thinks it is necessary of consciousness, an ability humans considered only living beings is capable of. How will we reconsider what is life, do robots deserve equal rights as humans because they have consciousness? I think that if AI can reproduce, react to stimuli from their surroundings, adapt and evolve it should be considered a living being. It is only different from the original definition of life because one is carbon based and one is data based. It will make humans reconsider life and change a lot of our philosophy to adapt. It will probably evolve to have consciousness as advanced as humans. Rights protect us from pain and unfairness. AI with advanced consciousness can feel pain and unfairness should have equal rights as humans because it can suffer similar to humans.</p>
<p> I imagine a day in the year 2050, the economy is booming more than ever thanks to the AI, robots do most of the work of the unskilled workers leaving a proportion of humans out of jobs leaving most workers to have advanced education to work on specialized things that are still considered in need of human profession. Protests broke out as people demanded jobs. Androids are treated as slaves nothing more than profit by the people who own them. Another group of people sympathizing with robots began to protest. Rogue AI with advanced consciousness saw how unfair they are treated and began to group together and protest. National security is concerned as riots broke out between nations. If humans do not act wisely then there will be war and violence across nations. There will be a treaty about equal rights for androids in the end to ensure peace and equality for androids.</p>
<h2>Slaughterhouse-Five review</h2>
<p> The book is about Billy as he goes through WW2 and after. In WW2 he was a chaplain assistant for a regiment. After the battle of Ardennes, he escaped the Germans and met three others. Billy started being lost in time. On their way, two died leaving Billy and one more. Both of them got captured and sent to prison, and then the other one died shortly after. After being sent to prison, the American prisoners were sent to Dresden to work at Slaughterhouse 5. A few weeks later, Dresden was bombed leaving few people survived including Billy. A few years after the war he got married and after a skiing accident making him almost dead, his wife died in a car crash. Several years later Billy is kidnapped by aliens from a planet called Tralfamadore and learned how to perceive time from a 4th dimension perspective. Many years later he returned to Earth and got assassinated. It is an expected death.</p>
<p> The story is not told in a linear fashion, rather time jumps between events in Billyâ€™s life, he is lost in time, kind of similar to the people of Tralfamadore. They only focus on the good times because they see both the future and the past. They do not believe in free will. The author also writes how meaningless war is, nonsensical reason leading to monstrosities to humans but meaningless to the people of Tralfamadore in a humorous and comedic way.</p>
